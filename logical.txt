Music
Music
Music
When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle
Oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily,
Oh, joyfully, oh, playfully
Watching me
Music
But then they sent me away
To teach me how to be sensible
Logical, oh, responsible, practical
And then they showed me a world
Where I could be so dependable
Oh, clinical, oh, intellectual
Cynical
There are times
When all the world's asleep
The questions run too deep
For such a simple man
Won't you please
Please tell me what we've learned
I know it sounds absurd
Please tell me who I am
I said, now watch what you say
Or they'll be calling you a radical
A liberal, oh, fanatical, criminal
Oh, won't you sign up your name
We'd like to feel you're acceptable
Respectable, oh, presentable
A vegetable
