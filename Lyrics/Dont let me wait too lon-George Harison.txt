Don't let my love pass you by girl
you may find you'r all alone
if I have to wait I am 
please don't me wait too long
it is lonely world nothing as forever
I can make it all life if we were together
if    and I can't wait much longer baby
Don't let my love pass you by girl
you may find you'r all alone
if I have to wait I am 
please don't me wait too long
