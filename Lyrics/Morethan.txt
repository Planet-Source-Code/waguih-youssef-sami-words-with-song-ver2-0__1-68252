Engle Bert Humperdinck

Lonely table just for one 	in a bright and crowded room
while the music has begun	I drink to memories in those room
Those the music still the same	it has a bitter sweet refrain 
So play the song the way it used to be
Before she left and change it all to sadness
and may be if she is passing by the window
she will hear a loud song and a melody
and even if the words are not so tender 
she will always remember the way it used to be

when stop-by say halo
and I laugh and Hi the same
It's quite easy to be go
and the song begins again

So play the song the way it used to be
Before she left and change it all to sadness
and may be if she is passing by the window
she will hear a loud song and a melody
and even if the words are not so tender 
she will always remember the way it used to be
