glad you're home
Now did you really miss me
I guess you did by the look in your eyes (look in your eyes, look in your eyes)
Well lay back and relax while I put away the dishes (put away the dishes)
Then you and me can rock-a-bye

You can ring my be-e-ell, ring my bell
You can ring my be-e-ell, ring my bell
You can ring my be-e-ell, ring my bell
You can ring my be-e-ell, ring my bell

The night is young and full of possibilities
Well come on and let yourself be free
My love for you, so long than I've been savin'
Tonight was made for me and you

You can ring my be-e-ell, ring my bell
You can ring my be-e-ell, ring my bell
You can ring my be-e-ell, ring my bell
You can ring my be-e-ell, ring my bell

you can ring my bell, you can ring my bell
(ding, dong, ding, do-ong)
you can ring my bell, you can ring my bell
(ding, dong, ding, do-ong, ring it!)
you can ring my bell, anytime, anyway
(ring it, ring it, ring it, ring it oww!)
you can ring my bell, anytime, anyway
(ding, dong, ding, do-ong)

you can ring my bell, you can ring my bell
(ding, dong, ding, do-ong)
you can ring my bell, you can ring my bell
(ding, dong, ding, do-ong, ring it!)
you can ring my bell, anytime, anyway
(ring it, ring it, ring it, ring it oww!)
you can ring my bell, anytime, anyway
(ding, dong, ding, do-ong)
